# Participation

## Participation guidance

### How to participate

Participation requires that **one contact person** from each team:

1.  Complete a [REGISTRATION](https://nd.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9MJ29y2xNrBOjqZ){target="_blank"} for each forecast theme you are participating in and each model you are contributing within a theme\
2.  The contact person agrees to the participation agreement below on behalf of the team\
3.  Submit forecast netCDF or csv file(s)\
4.  Provide the metadata xml file documenting the forecast

One contact person should register on behalf of their team. That contact person will be asked to provide the group members' names, emails, and affiliations so that everyone in the group can receive an invitation to join the Challenge theme Slack channel and access group resources.

Teams are allowed and encouraged to join the challenge after the start date of each Challenge theme because there are multiple deadlines to submit forecasts. However, only forecasts submitted by each submission deadline will be officially scored.

### Teams

Teams can be individuals or groups. They can represent institutions or organizations. No spaces are allowed in the team_name_id.  

The registration includes team categories (e.g., undergraduate only, graduate only, multi-institution, etc).

**If your team wants to submit multiple forecasts**, please register a different team name for each model . If there are two different time steps in a challenge theme (e.g., the terrestrial carbon flux theme has a 30-minute and 1-day option), register each as separate teams.

### Slack and GitHub Communication

Once your team is registered, everyone listed will receive an email with an invitation to join the EFI Slack group and the #neon4cast-help channel.

We strongly encourage participants to use the Challenge Slack channel to ask questions, discuss ideas and challenges, and share resources. Overall, we strongly encourage a collegial approach to the Challenge -- this is a friendly competition to move the field forward and bring more people into the community, not a cutthroat competition to win by denying other teams useful information.

### Archiving models

Teams are highly encouraged to publicly archive the code they are using for their forecast models and workflows. Information about where models are archived would be included in your metadata XML.

## Participation agreement

All participants agree to have their forecast posted in real-time on the NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge [Dashboard](https://shiny.ecoforecast.org/){target="_blank"} and potentially published in a scientific journal. The manuscripts describing the accuracy of forecasts across teams will be coordinated by the Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network and authorship will be extended to members of each team with an opt-in policy.

If a publication is generated by a forecast team, we ask that the manuscript acknowledge the Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network and its support from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1926388).

## NEON Data Use

NEON data products, software, and derivatives thereof are freely available for use when accompanied by appropriate disclaimers, acknowledgments, and data citations, defined in the [NEON data use policy](https://www.neonscience.org/data/about-data/data-policies){target="_blank"}.

The video below explains how to download and utilize NEON data for the Challenge. The video was recorded for the [2021 Early Career Annual Meeting](https://ecoforecast.org/ecological-forecasting-early-career-annual-meeting/){target="_blank"}

## Additional data options

Individuals and groups may create forecasts that use other publicly available data in addition to the NEON data. Teams are encouraged to make available the code they are using to access, download, and process any additional data constraints they are using, ideally via a Github repo.

As an example of potentially useful external data, each NEON site has subsets of various remote sensing products that are hosted on the ORNL DAAC (ORNL DAAC subsets). These include:

MODIS collection 6: LAI, FPAR, burned area, surface reflectance, land surface temperature, vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI), modeled ET, GPP, NPP.

VIIRS collection 1: surface reflectance, vegetation indices, LAI, FPAR, land surface temperature,

SMAP: modeled NEE, GPP, Rh, SOC

Daymet: daily surface weather data

The video below demonstrates how to access meteorological covariate data for the Challenge. The video was recorded for the [2021 Early Career Annual Meeting](https://ecoforecast.org/ecological-forecasting-early-career-annual-meeting/){target="_blank"}
