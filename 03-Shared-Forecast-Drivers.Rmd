# Meteorology Inputs{#met_inputs}

We are downloading, subsetting, and processing forecasted meteorology drivers for each NEON site.  Currently, we have NOAAâ€™s Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) V12 output available at the 1 hr time resolution for each NEON site.  

The following are important considerations when using the NOAA GEFS forecasts

- There are 31 ensemble members for each forecast.  Each ensemble member is available as a separate netcdf file.  
- For forecasts generated at four times per day.  The directories are organized by these cycles: 00, 06, 12, and 18 cycles
- For the midnight (00) UTC, the forecasts extend 35-days in the future for the ensemble members 01 - 30.  Ensemble member 00 only extends 16-days in the future.
- For forecasts generated at 06, 12, and 18 UTC, the forecasts extend 16-days in the future.  
- We are constantly downloading and processing the forecasts.  Since the 00 forecast runs 35-days in the future, it takes longer to download the complete forecast than the 06, 12, and 18 cycles.  As a result you may see the 00 forecast appear later than the other forecasts on the server.

The following meteorological variables are included:   
- air temperature   
- air pressure  
- wind speed   
- precipitation   
- downwelling longwave radiation   
- downwelling shortwave radiation   
- relative humidity   

The weather forecasts are available through an s3 bucket (see NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System below) with multiple ways to access them:
- You can click on a file in the browser, you can directly download individual files from the command line using the file address
- You can download multiple files using `aws.s3` commands.
- We provide an R function code in the [neon4cast package](https://github.com/eco4cast/neon4cast) called `noaa.R` for downloading all the ensemble members for particular location, forecast cycle (00, 06, 12, or 18), and NEON site

Additionally, we provide an R function code in the [neon4cast package](https://github.com/eco4cast/neon4cast) called `read_forecast.R` for converting the download netcdf files to a data frame.


## NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System

[1 Hour NOAA Drivers](https://data.ecoforecast.org/minio/drivers/noaa/NOAAGEFS_1hr/){target="_blank"}\

The data are organized by siteID/date/cycle where cycle is the hour of the day (UTC) that the forecast was started (00, 06, 12, 18).

## NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System Stacked

We have extracted the first hour of each NOAA GEFS forecast since September 2020 and combined them together to generate a continuous weather product that runs from September 2020 to present.  This is available for model calibration and seamlessly transitions to the current day's NOAA GEFS forecast

The data are organized by siteID.

## NEON Observed

Our goal is to make the observed weather at each NEON site available. This is currently in development through a collaboration with NEON and NCAR.
